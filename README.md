### Design

The design of the rating component was provided by Frontend Mentor. I simply had to download the design files & recreate it.

Designs for each state are shown below.

### Method

I chose not to download the figma design files as I didn't have the points on frontend mentor to do so.

Instead, I downloaded the images above and opened them in Figma. I then used the opaque framing tool to approximately gauge the px height & widths of divs as well as the padding and line-spacing.

For the submit rating functionality. Every time a number is clicked, the value of the span shown in the thank you state is changed to the number clicked. If a number isn't clicked prior to clicking the submit button, an alert will show up prompting the user to enter a number before continuing.
